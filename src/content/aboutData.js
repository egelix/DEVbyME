        part2: "What's more is, I take great joy in working in teams or collaborating with others. Learning from and pushing each other to improve on everyone's individual work and contributions makes the process of developing so much more interesting. That's why - although they say \"there's no I in team\" - ME could also stand for \"the me in team\" or even \"us\".",

You'll find some of my previous works and projects. But as a lot of those projects have been intended for learning and practice purposes only and are not meant for the \"public eye\", they are in private repositories on github and not or not fully reflected on this page. But now, with that said... happy scrolling!"
